Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) are organizations that allocate and manage IP address space within specific geographic regions worldwide. They play a crucial role in distributing and coordinating the assignment of IP addresses to Internet service providers and organizations within their respective regions.

RIRs receive their IP address spaces from [[IANA]]. The largest RIRs they serve are [[AFRINIC]], [[APNIC]], [[ARIN]], [[LACNIC]], and [[RIPE NCC]].
