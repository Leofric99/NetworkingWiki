An Open Virtualisation Appliance (OVA) is a standardised package format for virtual machines (VMs), bundling VM files into a single archive.

It simplifies the deployment and distribution of virtualised applications by encapsulating VM components such as disk images, configuration files, and metadata. OVAs enhance compatibility and ease of use across various virtualisation platforms, enabling efficient sharing and deployment of virtualised environments.
