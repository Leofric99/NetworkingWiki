**Protocol Data Unit**

The Protocol Data Unit is the collective term for a piece of information that is sent over a network. It includes both the actual data and extra information needed for communication, like addresses which are located in each layer's header and/or trailer. 

Different layers of a network call this unit by different names, such as ‘bit’, ‘frame’, ‘packet’, ‘segment’, or ‘data’. The list below shows the PDU term for each layer of [[The OSI Model]].

| Layer Number | Layer Name  | PDU Term |

|            1 | Physical    | Bit      |
|            2 | Data Link   | Frame    |
|            3 | Network     | Packet   |
|            4 | Transport   | Segment  |
