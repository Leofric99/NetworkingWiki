Secure Hash Algorithm 2 (SHA2) was developed by the [[NSA]]. It includes SHA-224 (224 bit), SHA-256 (256 bit), SHA-384 (384 bit), and SHA-512 (512 bit). 

*If* you are using SHA2, then the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms should be used whenever possible.

They are built using the Merkle–Damgård construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies–Meyer structure from a specialised block cipher.
