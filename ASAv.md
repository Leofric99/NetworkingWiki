description: A virtual ASA Firewall for virtual machines within a hypervisor.
---
The Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), is a ==virtualised version== of Cisco's [[ASAs]]. 

It provides the same robust security features as its hardware counterpart but ==can be deployed as a virtual machine==, offering greater flexibility and scalability in cloud environments or virtualised infrastructures.

## How it Works

A server hypervisor can create a ==virtual switch== capable of supporting many types of virtual machines (VMs). The Cisco ASAv operates as a VM using the server’s interfaces to process traffic.

## Versions

To provide a suitable fit for customer needs, Cisco ASAv is available in five models:

- **Cisco ASAv5** - This appliance requires 2 GB of memory and delivers up to 100 Mbps of stateful inspection throughput.
- **Cisco ASAv10** - This appliance requires 4 GB of memory and delivers up to 1 Gbps of stateful inspection throughput.
- **Cisco ASAv30** - This appliance requires 8 GB of memory and delivers up to 2 Gbps of stateful inspection throughput.
- **Cisco ASAv50** - This appliance requires 16 GB of memory and delivers up to 10 Gbps of stateful inspection throughput.
- **Cisco ASAv100** - This appliance requires 32 GB of memory and delivers up to 20 Gbps of stateful inspection throughput.
