AVC, or Application Visibility and Control, is a network management feature designed to identify and classify the applications running on a network. It enables administrators to gain insights into application usage patterns, allocate bandwidth resources efficiently, and enforce policies to control or prioritize specific applications. 

By offering visibility and control, AVC enhances network performance, security, and overall management. It is a core feature of [[NGIPS|Next Generation Intrusion Prevention Systems]].
