Many organisations must now also support Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). This enables employees to ==use their own mobile devices to access company systems, software, networks, or information==. BYOD provides several key benefits to enterprises, including increased productivity, reduced IT and operating costs, better mobility for employees, and greater appeal when it comes to hiring and retaining employees.

However, these benefits also bring an increased information security risk because BYOD can lead to data breaches and greater liability for the organization.

A BYOD security policy should be developed to accomplish the following:

- Specify the goals of the BYOD program.
- Identify which employees can bring their own devices.
- Identify which devices will be supported.
- Identify the level of access employees are granted when using personal devices.
- Describe the rights to access and activities permitted to security personnel on the device.
- Identify which regulations must be adhered to when using employee devices.
- Identify safeguards to put in place if a device is compromised.

The table lists BYOD security best practices to help mitigate BYOD vulnerabilities.

| **Best Practice** | **Description** |
| ---- | ---- |
| Password protected access | Use unique passwords for each device and account. |
| Manually control wireless connectivity | Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity when not in use. Connect only to trusted networks. |
| Keep updated | Always keep the device OS and other software updated. Updated software often contains security patches to mitigate against the latest threats or exploits. |
| Back up data | Enable backup of the device in case it is lost or stolen. |
| Enable “Find my Device” | Subscribe to a device locator service with remote wipe feature. |
| Provide antivirus software | Provide antivirus software for approved BYOD devices. |
| Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) software | MDM software enables IT teams to implement security settings and software configurations on all devices that connect to company networks. |
