SOHO stands for "Small Office/Home Office." 

It refers to a category of businesses or workplaces that are typically small in scale, often consisting of ==one to ten employees==, and are operated either from a home or a small office space. 

SOHO environments are common among freelancers, independent professionals, small start-ups, and remote workers.
