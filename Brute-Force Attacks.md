description: Submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.
---
In [[Cryptology]], a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.

When choosing a [[Cryptology#Cryptanalysis]] method, consider the [[Substitution Ciphers#Caesar Cipher]]. The best way to crack this code is to use brute-force. Because there are ==only 25 possible rotations==, the effort is relatively small to try all possible rotations and see which one returns something that makes sense.
