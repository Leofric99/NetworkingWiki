Broadcast domains are a section of a network which will receive a broadcast frame (with destination [[Studies/MAC|MAC Address]] of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) sent from another device in the network.

If device A sends a broadcast, and devices B, C, and D receive its frame then they must all be within one single broadcast domain.
