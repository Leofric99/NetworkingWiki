Firewalls utilise stateful inspection and predefined security policies to ==filter network traffic== at layers of [[The OSI Model]], dynamically permitting authorised flows while blocking unauthorised or anomalous connections based on IP addresses, protocols, ports, and content analysis. 

In essence, they function as a ==critical security barrier== between trusted internal networks and potentially hostile external environments.

All firewalls share some common properties:

- They are resistant to network attacks.
- They are the only transit point between internal corporate networks and external networks because all traffic flows through the firewall.
- They enforce the access control policy.

## Firewall Types

It is important to understand the different [[Types of Firewall|types of firewalls]] and their specific capabilities so that the right firewall is used for each situation.

## ZPFs

The next step up from traditional firewalls are ZPFs.
