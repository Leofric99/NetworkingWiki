description: A Cisco proprietary port aggregation protocol.

PAgP stands for Port Aggregation Protocol. 

Unlike [[LACP]], it's a Cisco proprietary protocol, meaning it only works on Cisco switches or on switches licensed by vendors to support PAgP. Similar to LACP, it facilitates the automatic creation of [[EtherChannel|EtherChannels]] by exchanging PAgP packets between Ethernet ports.
