Rapid Switched Port Analyser (RSPAN) is similar to [[SPAN]] in that it enables the mirroring of network traffic from multiple switches. 

Where it differs from SPAN is that it allows for the mirrored traffic to be sent to a designated remote monitoring station, facilitating comprehensive analysis and troubleshooting across distributed network segments.
