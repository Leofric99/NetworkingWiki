description: The precursor to IPv6. An unofficial IPv5.
---
The Internet Stream Protocol was developed in the late 1970s but was never actually released for public use. It was never called IPv5, but it used a value of 5 in the version field of the IP header.

This is the reason, why [[IPv4]] jumps straight to [[IPv6]].
