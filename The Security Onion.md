A common analogy used to describe a defence-in-depth approach is called “the security onion.” As illustrated in figure, a threat actor would have to peel away at a network’s defences layer by layer in a manner similar to peeling an onion. Only after penetrating each layer would the threat actor reach the target data or system.

**Note**: The security onion described on this page is a way of visualizing defence-in-depth. This is not to be confused with the Security Onion suite of network security tools.
