High availability (HA) in computer networking refers to the design and implementation of systems and infrastructure that ==ensure== a service or network ==remains operational== and accessible for users even in the event of hardware failures, software glitches, or other disruptions. 

It involves ~~redundant components~~, ~~failover mechanisms~~, and ~~proactive monitoring~~ to minimise downtime and maintain seamless operation, thereby enhancing reliability and ensuring uninterrupted access to critical resources or services.
