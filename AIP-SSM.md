The Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Module (AIP-SSM) is a module that provides intrusion prevention capabilities to Cisco [[ASAs]]. 

Similar to [[AIP-SSC]], it is designed to detect and block malicious traffic, preventing unauthorised access and mitigating security threats in real-time. By employing advanced detection techniques, the AIP-SSM identifies and responds to various types of attacks, helping organisations maintain a secure and resilient network infrastructure. 

It integrates seamlessly with the [[ASAs|ASA]] platform, offering enhanced security functionality without the need for additional hardware devices.
