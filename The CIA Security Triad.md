Information security deals with protecting information and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The CIA Triad serves as a conceptual foundation for the field.

As shown in the figure, the CIA triad consists of three components of information security:

- **Confidentiality** - Only authorised individuals, entities, or processes can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity** - This refers to the protection of data from unauthorised alteration. Usually when in-transit.
- **Availability** - Authorised users must have uninterrupted access to the network resources and data that they require.

Network data can be encrypted (made unreadable to unauthorised users) using various [[Cryptology]] applications. Cryptography can be used almost anywhere that there is data communication. In fact, the trend is toward all communication being encrypted.
