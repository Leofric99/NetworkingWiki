A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, is a cyberattack that tries to ==exploit software vulnerabilities== that are ~~unknown~~ or ~~undisclosed~~ by the software vendor, as shown in the figure. The term 'zero-day' describes the moment when a previously unknown threat is identified.

During the time it takes the software vendor to develop and release a patch, the entire network can be vulnerable to these exploits. 

## Defending Against Zero-Day Attacks

Defending against these fast-moving attacks requires network security professionals to adopt a more sophisticated view of the network architecture. It is no longer possible to contain intrusions at a few points in the network.
