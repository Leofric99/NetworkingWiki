The Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Card (AIP-SSC) is a module that enhances the security capabilities of Cisco [[ASAs|ASA]] devices. 

Similar to the [[AIP-SSM]], it provides intrusion prevention features but is designed to be installed on specific ASA models that support SSC slots. 

The AIP-SSC offers advanced inspection and prevention capabilities to protect networks from a wide range of cyber threats. It helps organisations enforce security policies, detect and block malicious traffic, and maintain the integrity and availability of their network infrastructure.
