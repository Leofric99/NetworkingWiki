Endpoint security focuses on protecting individual devices, such as computers, smartphones, and servers, from potential cyber threats and unauthorised access.

## Borderless Networks

With the introduction of [[BYOD]], the borders of a company's [[LANs|LAN]] have been blurred because access to network resources can be initiated by users from many locations using various connectivity methods.

Larger organisations now require protection before, during, and after an attack. IT administrators must be able to answer the following questions:

- Where did the attack come from?
- What was the exploit method and point of entry?
- What systems were affected?
- What did the exploit do?
- How do we recover from the exploit?
- How can we mitigate the vulnerability and root cause?

## Network-Based Malware Protection

New security architectures for the borderless network address security challenges by having endpoints use ==network scanning elements==. These devices provide many more layers of scanning than a single endpoint possibly could. 

Network-based malware prevention devices are also capable of ==sharing information among themselves== to make better informed decisions.

[[AMP]], [[ESAs]], [[WSAs]], and [[NAC|NAC methods]] work in concert with each other to give more protection than host-based suites can provide, as shown in the image below.
