Stream normalization is a method of standardising diverse network traffic before analysis; it enhances an [[IPS|Intrusion Prevention System's]] ability to detect and mitigate security threats.. 

It ensures that data is in a consistent format, allowing the IPS to apply uniform detection mechanisms across different protocols. 

This is crucial for effective threat identification and prevention, addressing potential vulnerabilities in the interpretation of various data streams. Ultimately, stream normalisation enhances the IPS's ability to detect and mitigate security threats.
