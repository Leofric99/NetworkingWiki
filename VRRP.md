VRRP, or Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol, is a networking protocol that automatically assigns available routers to participating devices on a network. 

It basically creates a virtual router that represents a group of physical routers, with one acting as the primary (active) and others as backups. This improves network reliability by ensuring continuous routing even if the primary router fails.
