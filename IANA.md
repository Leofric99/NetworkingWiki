The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a key organization responsible for the global coordination of the Internet's root, IP addressing, and protocol number spaces. It allocates and manages unique identifiers critical for the stable operation of the Internet. It is currently a part of [[ICANN]].

IANA assigns IP Addresses, and IP Address ranges to companies, organisations, and governments around the world based on their size known as [[RIRs]]. They used to do this using the [[IPv4#Address Classes]], but this wasted many [[IPv4]] Address ranges.
