description: A vendor-neutral Layer 2 protocol used for discovering and sharing information about neighbouring network devices.
---
LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is a standardised Layer 2 protocol that enables network devices to advertise and discover information about neighbouring devices on the same network segment. 

It allows devices to exchange information such as device capabilities, system name, and port identifier, facilitating network topology discovery and management. LLDP operates independently of vendor-specific protocols, promoting interoperability in heterogeneous network environments.

The Cisco proprietary protocol for the same task is known as [[CDP]].
