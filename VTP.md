The VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), is a Cisco proprietary networking protocol that facilitates the automatic propagation of VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) configuration information across a network. 

It enables consistent VLAN configuration across multiple switches, reducing the need for manual VLAN configuration on each switch in the network.
