NGIPSs (Next Generation Intrusion Prevention Systems) are dedicated [[IPS]] appliances. They are built on Snort's core open technology and use vulnerability-focused IPS rules and embedded IP, URL, and DNS-based security intelligence provided by Cisco Talos.

## NGIPS Features

Features of NGIPSs are as follows:

1. IPS rules that ==identify and block== attack traffic targeted at network vulnerabilities.
2. Tightly integrated defence against advanced malware by incorporating ==advanced analysis== of network and endpoint activity.
3. ==Sandboxing== technology that uses hundreds of behavioural indicators to identify zero-day and evasive attacks.
4. [[AVC]]
5. [[AMP]]
6. URL Filtering.
