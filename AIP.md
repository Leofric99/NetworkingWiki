---
Cisco Advanced Inspection and Prevention (AIP) modules are hardware components designed to enhance network security by providing intrusion prevention capabilities.

These modules can be installed in Cisco [[ASAs|ASA]] devices to detect and block malicious traffic, preventing unauthorised access and mitigating security threats in real-time. They employ advanced detection techniques to identify and respond to various types of attacks, helping organisations maintain a secure and resilient network infrastructure.
