To deploy [[Snort]] IPS on supported devices, perform the following steps:

1. Download the Snort [[OVA]] file.  
2. Install the OVA file.  
3. Configure [[VPG]] interfaces.  
4. Activate the virtual services.  
5. Configure Snort specifics.  
6. Enable [[IPS]] globally or on desired interfaces.  
7. Verify Snort IPS.

## Configuration Commands

#### Install the package

Once the Snort [[OVA]] file has been downloaded and saved to a location available to the [[ISR]] router, we can install the package:

| Mode | Command | Description | Variables `{}` or Options `[]` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Privileged Exec | `virtual-service install name {name} [package / media] {location}` | Installs the Snort Package | `{name}` is the name you want to assign to the virtual service instance. `[package]` should be specified if the `.ova` file is on the device locally. `[media]` should be specified when the `.ova` file is stored externally (eg. at a url). `{location}` is the location of the `.ova` file. |

#### Configure the [[VPG]] interfaces

With the Snort package installed, we can configure the [[VPG]] interfaces. One for management, and one for data. ==Repeat the commands below== for each, only changing the interface name, IP addresses, and description. The management one should have a ~~routable~~ IP address. The data one should have a ~~non-routable~~ (private) address.

| Mode | Command | Description | Variables `{}` or Options `[]` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config` | `interface {interface}` | Enters Interface Configuration Mode. | `{interface}` is the interface name. In this case, you would use `VirtualPortGroup0`, then `VirtualPortGroup1` etc. |
| `config-if` | `description {description}` | Adds an interface description. | `{description}` is the desired description. |
| `config-if` | `ip address {ip-add} {subnet}` | Adds an IP address to the interface. | `{ip-addr}` is the IP address for the interface. `{subnet}` is the subnet mask for the network. |

#### Configure the Guest IPs

With the VPG interfaces configured, we can configure guest IPs on the same subnet for the container side (the internal container addresses) and activate the virtual service.

| Mode | Command | Description | Variables `{}` or Options `[]` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config` | `virtual-service {name}` | Enters virtual service config mode for a certain service. | `{name}` is the virtual service name as configured at the start of the configuration. |
| `config-virt-serv` | `vnic gateway {interface}` | Creates a virtual network interface card (vNIC) gateway interface for the virtual container service and maps the vNIC gateway interface to the virtual port group. | `{interface}` is the VPG interface name configured in the second step that you want to use for either the management or data interface. |
| `config-virt-serv-vnic` | `guest ip address {ip-addr}` | Configures a guest vNIC address for the vNIC gateway interface. | `{ip-addr}` is the desired address (not the one you used in step two). These addresses should follow the same rules as in step two though. |
| `config-virt-serv` | `activate` | Activates the application installed in a virtual container service. | N/A |

#### Configure Snort Specifics

| Mode | Command | Description | Variables `{}` or Options `[]` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config` | `utd engine standard` | Configures the UTD standard engine and enters UTD standard engine configuration mode. | N/A |
| `config-utd-eng-std` | `logging host {ip-addr}` | Sets the logging server address. | `{ip-addr}` the IP address of the logging server. |
| `config-utd-eng-std` | `logging syslog` | Enables syslog. | N/A |
| `config-utd-eng-std` | `threat-inspection` | Configures threat inspection for the Snort engine. | N/A |
| `config-utd-engstd-insp` | `threat [protection / detection]` | Configures the threat inspection mode. | `[protection]` sets snort to [[IPS]] mode. `[detection]` sets snort to [[IDS]] mode. |
| `config-utd-engstd-insp` | `policy [balanced / connectivity / security]` | Specifies which security policy to implement | `[balanced]` sets the balanced policy. `[connectivity]` sets the connectivity protection. `[security]` sets the security protection. |
| `config-utd-engstd-insp` | `signature update occur-at [daily / monthly {dom} / weekly {dow}] {hour} {minute}` | Specifies how frequently to update the security signatures. | `[daily]` sets signature update to daily. `[monthly {dom}]` sets signature update to monthly, on the specified day of the month. `[weekly {dow}]` sets signature update to weekly on the specified day of the week. `{hour}` is the hour of the day to update. `{minute}` is the minute of the hour to update at. |
| `config-utd-engstd-insp` | `signature update server [username {username} password {password}]` | Configures the signature update server details for update server (details not always required). | `[username {username} password {password}` is the username and password for the user on the server you are going to fetch updates from (details not always required). |
| `config-utd-engstd-insp` | `logging level {level}` | Sets the type of syslog messages that will be generated. | `{level}` is the Syslog level of messages. It can either be a number or the descriptor. |

#### Enable IPS

Based on the organisational requirements, [[Snort]] can be enabled globally (i.e. on all the interfaces) or on selected interfaces.

##### Globally

| Mode | Command | Description | Variables `{}` or Options `[]` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `config` | `utd` | Enters UTD config mode. | N/A |
| `config-utd` | `engine-standard` | Configures the Snort-based UTD engine and enters standard engine configuration mode. | N/A |
| `config-utd` | `all-interfaces` | Enables UTD on all layer three interfaces. | N/A |
| `config-engine-std` | `fail [open / close]` | Set fail open or fail closed. | `[open]` When there is a UTD engine failure, this option allows all of the IPS/IDS traffic through without being inspected. `[close]` If enabled, this option drops all the IPS/IDS traffic when there is an UTD engine failure. Therefore, no traffic will be allowed to leave. |

##### Selected Interfaces

| `config-engine-std` | `fail [open / close]` | Set fail open or fail closed. | `[open]` When there is a UTD engine failure, this option allows all of the IPS/IDS traffic through without being inspected. `[close]` If enabled, this option drops all the IPS/IDS traffic when there is an UTD engine failure. Therefore, no traffic will be allowed to leave. |
| `config` | `interface {interface}` | Enters interface config mode | `{interface}` is the desired interface to enable the IDS or IPS on. |
