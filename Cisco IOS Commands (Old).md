5. `nat64 v6v4 static` - Defines static NAT64 translations for specific IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
6. `nat64 prefix translation {ipv6-prefix} {ipv4-prefix}` - Configures the IPv6-to-IPv4 prefix translation, allowing IPv6 clients to access IPv4 resources.
7. `ipv6 access-list` - You might use IPv6 access lists to control which IPv6 traffic gets translated by NAT64.
8. `show nat64 translations` - Displays the NAT64 translation table, showing the mappings between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.
9. `ntp server x.x.x.x` - Sets the clock server for the network
10. `show ntp associations` - Verify NTP conf.
11. `show ntp status` - More NTP verification, displays stratum information (how far the device is away from the time source.

## RIP Commands

- `router rip` - Enter router RIP config mode
- `version 2` - version 1 may not work with NAT
- `network {network address without subnet mask or wildcard mask}` - Repeat this for any directly connected networks (including LANs).

## EIGRP Commands:

- `router eigrp` `{as number}` - Enter EIGRP config mode. AS Number is an identifier for EIGRP domains (Must be the same value for any EIGRP router in the WAN network topology).
- `network {network address} {wildcard mask}` - Repeat this for any directly connected networks (including LANs).
- `eigrp router-id {router id}` - The router ID can be anything in IP address form eg. 1.1.1.1 or 2.2.2.2 or 1.0.0.0 or 1.0.0.1.

## OSPF Commands

#### Basic OSPF Setup

- `router ospf {process-id}` - This is OSPF config mode. The Process ID is simply an identifier for the OSPF operation on the router.
- `network {network-address} {network-wildcard-mask} area {area-id}` - Sets the networks for which OSPF is needed and therefore also identifies the interfaces that will participate. Do not enter networks which are not part of the OSPF network like a link to the ISP. Must be run inside the OSPF config mode.

#### Other OSPF Commands

- `router-id {router-id}` - The router ID can be anything in IP address form eg. 1.1.1.1 or 2.2.2.2 or 1.0.0.0 or 1.0.0.1. Must be run inside the OSPF config mode.
- `auto-cost reference-bandwidth {desired-bandwidth}` - Must be run in OSPF config mode. Sets a desired reference bandwidth for OSPF calculations in order for calculations to be a better match for network environment. Bandwidth is in Mbps.
- `default-information originate [always]` - Must be used in OSPF config mode. Inject a default route (0.0.0.0) into OSPF, which can be useful for routing to unknown destinations. The optional `always` keyword forces the default route to be advertised even if it's not in the routing table.
- `passive-interface {interface}` - Sets the interface as passive which will prevent OSPF updates, and hello messages from being set out from that interface. Must be run inside the OSPF config mode.
- `passive-interface default` - Set all interfaces to passive mode (no OSPF hellos sent or received), and then selectively enable OSPF on specific interfaces using the `no passive-interface` command.
- `ip ospf priority {priority}` - Must be run in interface config mode. Sets the router priority. The default is 1, but can be set anywhere from 1-255. The highest priority in the area will become DR.
- `ip ospf hello-interval {seconds}` - Must be set in interface config mode. Sets the hello interval to a desired duration. The default is 10 seconds.
- `ip ospf dead-interval {seconds}` - Must be set in interface config mode. Sets the dead interval to a desired duration. The default is 40 seconds.
- `ip ospf cost {desired-cost-value}` - Must be set in interface config mode. Sets the cost to a manual value eg. 10, or 100.
- `redistribute {source-protocol} {subnets}` - Redistribute routes from another routing protocol (e.g., EIGRP or RIP) into OSPF.
- `area {area id} authentication message-digest` - Enable OSPF authentication using MD5 authentication for a specific OSPF area.
- `area {area id} authentication message-digest key {key-id} md5 {key}` - Configure MD5 authentication for a specific OSPF area, specifying the authentication key and key ID.
- `area {area id} virtual-link {router-id}` - Create a virtual link to connect a router to an OSPF area that is not directly connected to the backbone area (Area 0).
- `ip ospf network point-to-point` - Configure an interface as a point-to-point OSPF network type.
- `ip ospf hello-interval {seconds}` - Set the frequency (in seconds) at which OSPF hello packets are sent on an interface.
- `ip ospf dead-interval {seconds}` - Configure the dead interval (in seconds) for OSPF hello packets on an interface.
- `ip ospf priority {value}` - Set the priority value for the router in the DR (Designated Router) election process.
- `ip ospf cost {value}` - Manually set the OSPF cost for an interface, influencing the route preference.
- `area {area id} range {ip-range} [advertise | not-advertise]` - Summarize routes within an OSPF area, specifying whether to advertise or suppress the summary route.
- `ip ospf flood-reduction` - Enable OSPF LSA (Link-State Advertisement) flood reduction, reducing LSA propagation.
- `area {area id} stub [no-summary]` - Configure an OSPF area as a stub area. The `no-summary` option prevents Type 3 LSAs (summary LSAs) from being sent into the stub area.
- `area {area id} nssa [no-redistribution]` - Configure an OSPF area as a Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA). The `no-redistribution` option prevents external route redistribution into the NSSA area.
