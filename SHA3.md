The Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA3) is the newest hashing algorithm and was introduced by the [[NIST]] as an alternative and eventual replacement for the [[SHA2]] family of hashing algorithms. 

SHA3 includes SHA3-224 (224 bit), SHA3-256 (256 bit), SHA3-384 (384 bit), and SHA3-512 (512 bit). The SHA3 family are next-generation algorithms and ==should be used whenever possible== as of time of writing (2024).
