## CRUD Variables

- **Create** - Used to create new variables on a server and insert their initial values. For example, create variable "ip_address" and set the value to "10.0.0.1".
- **Read** - Used to retrieve the value of a variable. This is equivalent to an HTTP GET request. For example, what is the value of variable "ip_address" to which, "10.0.0.1" would be returned.
- **Update** - Used to change the value of a variable. For example, change the value of "ip_address" to "10.0.0.2".
- **Delete** - Used to delete variables. For example, you could delete the variable "ip_address".
