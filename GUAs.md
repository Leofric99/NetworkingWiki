description: Globally identifiable and uniquely addressable IPv6 addresses.

Global Unicast Addresses are public [[IPv6]] addresses which can be used over the internet. GUAs *must* be registered with a [[RIRs|RIR]] so that they are definitely unique.

The address space for GUAs used to be `2000::/3`, but has since been updated to comprise *any* IPv6 address which isn't pre-allocated for another use.
