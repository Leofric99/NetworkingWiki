To protect network devices, it is important to use strong passwords. Here are standard guidelines to follow:

- Use a password length of at least eight characters, preferably 10 or more characters. A longer password is a more secure password.
- Make passwords complex. Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces, if allowed.
- Avoid passwords based on repetition, common dictionary words, letter or number sequences, usernames, relative or pet names, biographical information, such as birthdates, ID numbers, ancestor names, or other easily identifiable pieces of information.
- Deliberately misspell a password. For example, Smith = Smyth = 5mYth or Security = 5ecur1ty.
- Change passwords often. If a password is unknowingly compromised, the window of opportunity for the threat actor to use the password is limited.
- Do not write passwords down and leave them in obvious places such as on the desk or monitor.

The tables show examples of strong and weak passwords.

|Weak Password|Why it is Weak|
|---|---|
|secret|Simple dictionary password|
|smith|Maiden name of mother|
|toyota|Make of a car|
|bob1967|Name and birthday of the user|
|Blueleaf23|Simple words and numbers|

|Strong Password|Why it is Strong|
|---|---|
|b67n42d39c|Combines alphanumeric characters|
|12^h u4@1p7|Combines alphanumeric characters, symbols, and includes a space|

On Cisco routers, leading spaces are ignored for passwords, but spaces after the first character are not. Therefore, one method to create a strong password is to use the space bar and create a phrase made of many words. This is called a passphrase. A passphrase is often easier to remember than a simple password. It is also longer and harder to guess.

**Password Managers**  
Use a password manager to secure passwords for your online internet activity. Considered to be the best practice to secure passwords, the password manager automatically generates complex passwords for you and will automatically enter them when you access those sites. You only have to enter a primary password to enable this feature.

**Multi-Factor Authentication**  
Use multi-factor authentication when available. This means that authentication requires two or more independent means of verification. For example when you enter a password, you would also have to enter a code that is sent to you through email or text message.
