description: A symmetric block cipher used for encryption.
---
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) isÂ a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information. 

AES is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. It is essential for government computer security, cybersecurity and electronic data protection.

## Characteristics

The table displays the characteristics of the AES encryption algorithm. Notice how AES uses ==long key lengths==. This dramatically increases the [[PSKs#Keyspace|keyspace]] which affects the time it takes to crack the code.

|**Characteristic**|Description|
|---|---|
|**Algorithm Full Name**|Advanced Encryption Standard|
|**Timeline**|Official standard since 2001|
|**Type of Algorithm**|Symmetric|
|**Key Size (in bits)**|128, 192, and 256|
|**Speed**|High|
|**Time to Crack  <br>(assuming a computer could try 255 keys per second)**|149 trillion years|
|**Resource Consumption**|Low|
