Per-port [[VLANs|VLAN]] [[ACLs]], or PVACLs, are a network security feature that allows the configuration of access control lists on individual switch ports based on VLAN membership, enabling granular control over traffic entering or leaving specific VLANs.

It does this based on *IP-to-MAC-to-switch-port* bindings.
