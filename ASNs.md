Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) are unique numerical identifiers assigned to networks connected to the Internet, enabling them to exchange routing information independently. 

ASNs play a crucial role in defining routing policies and facilitating efficient data traffic flow across the global Internet infrastructure. For more information about ASNs, see [[AS|Autonomous Systems]].
