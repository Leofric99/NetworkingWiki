## Overview

## Project Ideas

- **Multi-Area OSPF** is a useful tool when designing large, and scalable, routed networks. With the aim of improving network performance I will investigate how the number of routers per-area affects network performance with, and without, regular topology changes.
- **Wi-Fi Antenna Types** in-use globally differ significantly and are designed to provide for certain markets with *Omnidirectional* at one extreme, and *Highly Directional* at the other. With the aim of improving network performance I will be investigating, assuming a requirement for the greatest possible distance *and* the greatest possible coverage, what are the ideal distances at which should the antenna type be changed.
- **The Global DNS** System is an aging architecture with many potential flaws. With the aim of improving global infrastructure security, and performance, I will investigate if there is a better system than the layered domain system.
