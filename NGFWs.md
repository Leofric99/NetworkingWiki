Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), are advanced network security appliances that combine traditional firewall capabilities with additional features such as intrusion prevention, application control, and advanced threat protection.

Unlike traditional firewalls that primarily focus on port and protocol filtering, NGFWs inspect and filter traffic at the application layer, allowing for more granular control and better visibility into network activities.
