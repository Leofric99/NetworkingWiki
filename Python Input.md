The Python input function gets the user to input text which is then passed to the program (usually as a variable).

## How is the Input Function Called?

An example of the input function can be seen below. In this example, the variable used to record the user's input is `FirstName`:

```
FirstName = input("What is your first name? ")
```

The returned value will *always* be a string.
