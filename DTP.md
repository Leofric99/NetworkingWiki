description: A Cisco proprietary protocol for negotiating layer two trunking.
---
The Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) is a proprietary layer two protocol developed byÂ Cisco for the purpose of negotiating trunking on a link.

DTP is enabled on ~~Cisco~~ switches by default. It ==automatically== configures the interface status (access or trunk) based on various metrics. Due to the automatic nature of DTP, it is recommended to be disabled for security.

These commands are found on the [[VLAN Commands]] page.
