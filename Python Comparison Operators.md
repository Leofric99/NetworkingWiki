Python comparison operators can be used to compare values. These can be used in if statements or similar to make programming decisions.

| ==       | equal to                 | x == y   |
| !=       | not equal to             | x != y   |
| >        | greater than             | x > y    |
| >=       | greater than or equal to | x >= y   |
