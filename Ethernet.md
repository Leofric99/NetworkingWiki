Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards which are defined in the ==IEEE 802.3== standard which was released in ==1983==. 

The different standards laid out by this standard are detailed in the table below. All of these standards of cable have a maximum length of around ==100 metres==.

|  10 Mbps | Ethernet         | IEEE 802.3i  |
|:---------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| 100 Mbps | Fast Ethernet    | IEEE 802.3u  |
|   1 Gbps | Gigabit Ethernet | IEEE 802.3ab |
|  10 Gbps |  10 Gig Ethernet | IEEE 802.3an |  

The cables used in the Ethernet standard are UTP cables. Unshielded Twisted Pair. The twisted nature of these cables protects the signals inside from Electromagnetic interference.
