Fibre-optic cables consist of four layers.

1. The inner fibreglass core itself.
2. Cladding that reflects the light travelling through the core.
3. A protective buffer.
4. The outer protective jacket.

Fibre optic cables generally terminate with an SFP port, rather than a [[UTP Cables]]' RJ-45 Port.

There are two different types of fibre-optic cables. Multimode, and Single-mode. The core of the cable is larger in multimode fibre than that of single-mode, and therefore the light travels in a less predictable, chaotic path.

The bottom cable in the diagram is single-mode fibre. This type of fibre is more expensive than multimode fibre, as it uses lasers, rather than multimode which uses LEDs.

Single-mode allows for the longest cables, whereas multimode fibre allows for cables which are longer than UTP cables, but not as long as single-mode fibre.

Like [[Ethernet]], Fibre-optic cables are also defined in ==IEEE 802.3==. The table below shows the different specifications.

| Speed   | IEEE Standard | Cable Type               | Maximum Length                       |
|:--------|:--------------|:-------------------------|:-------------------------------------|
|  1 Gbps |        802.3z | Multimode or Single-Mode | 550 Metres (MM) or 5 Kilometres (SM) |
| 10 Gbps |       802.3ae | Multimode                |                           400 Metres |
| 10 Gbps |       802.3ae | Single-Mode              |                        10 Kilometres |
| 10 Gbps |       802.3ae | Single-Mode              |                        30 Kilometres |
